# Overview
[FreeCompilerCamp](http://freecompilercamp.org) (currently alive) is a free and open online training platform aimed to automate the training of compiler developers. Our platform allows anyone who is interested in developing compilers to learn the necessary skills for free. The platform is built on top of Play-With-Docker, a docker playground for users to conduct experiments in a sandbox. We welcome anyone to try out our system, give us feedback, contribute new training courses, or enhance the training platform to make it an effective learning resource for the compiler community.

While this platform can be used to host any compiler tutorials, we specially collect some tutorials for OpenMP compilers. We have created some initial tutorials to train users to learn how to use the ROSE or Clang/LLVM compiler to support OpenMP.
